# FlappyBird

The project focuses on building a *Flappy Bird–style game* with more depth than the classic version. In addition to avoiding obstacles, the player can collect various *boosts*, such as extra lives, temporary invincibility, and bonus points. The game also includes *enemies* that actively challenge the player and make the gameplay more dynamic and less predictable.

A key part of the project is experimenting with *different level generation approaches*. We plan to test *search-based methods* (e.g. optimization or evolutionary techniques) alongside *manually designed levels created with map editors*. The goal is to compare these approaches in terms of gameplay quality, difficulty balance, and player experience.
